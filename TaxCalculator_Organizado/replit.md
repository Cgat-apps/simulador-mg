# Pricing Simulator with Tax Substitution (ST) - MG Branch

## Overview

This is a full-stack pricing simulator application specifically designed for wholesale operations in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The application helps calculate optimal pricing with tax substitution (ST) considerations. It features both direct pricing calculations (from cost to price) and reverse calculations (from target price to required cost).

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript as the main frontend framework
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS** with shadcn/ui components for styling
- **Wouter** for client-side routing
- **React Query** for state management and API calls
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation for form handling

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** server with TypeScript
- **ESM modules** for modern JavaScript support
- RESTful API design with JSON responses
- Middleware for request logging and error handling
- File export services for PDF and Excel generation

### Database Design
- **Drizzle ORM** configured for PostgreSQL
- **Neon Database** as the serverless PostgreSQL provider
- Simple user schema with authentication capabilities
- Session management using PostgreSQL store

## Key Components

### Pricing Calculator Engine
- **Direct Calculation**: Computes final pricing from purchase costs
- **Reverse Calculation**: Determines required costs from target prices
- **Tax Calculations**: Handles IPI, ICMS, PIS/COFINS, and ST calculations
- **Margin Analysis**: Calculates markup and profit margins

### Export System
- **PDF Export**: Generates detailed pricing reports using jsPDF
- **Excel Export**: Creates comprehensive spreadsheets using ExcelJS
- **Data Formatting**: Includes all calculation steps and intermediate results

### User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Interactive Forms**: Real-time calculations as users input data
- **Tab Navigation**: Separate interfaces for direct and reverse calculations
- **Export Modal**: Streamlined export options with format selection

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: Purchase data (costs, taxes, freight) and sales parameters (margins, MVA, payment conditions)
2. **Real-time Calculation**: Automatic computation of intermediate values and final pricing
3. **Result Display**: Formatted presentation of pricing results and calculations
4. **Export Generation**: Server-side document creation with complete calculation details

- **jspdf**: PDF generation library
- **exceljs**: Excel file creation
- **connect-pg-simple**: PostgreSQL session store

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Replit**: Integrated development environment
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Vite HMR for rapid development
- **PostgreSQL 16**: Database provisioning through Replit
- **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL for database connection

### Production Build
- **Vite Build**: Optimized frontend bundle
- **ESBuild**: Backend compilation with external packages
- **Static Serving**: Express serves built frontend files
- **Autoscale Deployment**: Replit's autoscale deployment target
